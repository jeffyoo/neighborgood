        Safety scores are calculated based on
        <a href='https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Crimes-2012-2015/s9rj-h3s6'>crime data</a>
        reported for California in 2015.The dataset is filtered for violent crimes
        (homicide, rape, robbery and assault)reported within 5 km of the user's address. Crime rates are estimated using
        <a href="http://www.datasciencetoolkit.org/developerdocs#coordinates2statistics">population density data</a>
        for the area, compared to the range of crime rates reported for cities in LA and assigned a score based on where
        the neighborhood's crime rates fall.
